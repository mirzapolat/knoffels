# Knoffels

Knoffels is an engaging dice game inspired by the German game "Kniffel" (known as Yahtzee in English-speaking countries). In this digital adaptation, players roll five dice and strategically aim to achieve specific combinations over 13 rounds.

The game combines luck with tactical decision-making as players must choose which scoring category to fill after each roll. Players get up to three rolls per turn to achieve their desired combination. Categories include:

- Singles (Ones through Sixes)
- Three of a Kind
- Four of a Kind
- Full House (Three of one number and two of another)
- Small Straight (Four sequential numbers)
- Large Straight (Five sequential numbers)
- Knoffels/Yahtzee (Five of the same number)
- Chance (Sum of all dice)

What makes Knoffels particularly exciting is the balance between risk and reward - should you settle for a lower score in a category, or push your luck with remaining rolls? The digital format adds convenience while maintaining the classic gameplay that has made this dice game a beloved pastime for generations.
